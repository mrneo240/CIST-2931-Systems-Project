                                    <h4>Disputes</h4>
                                    <p><strong>(a) Disputes and Claims.</strong> 
                                        If any dispute or claim of any type arises between us with regard to your use of the Express Car Parts website or any products or services sold or distributed through the website, the dispute or claim will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than through the courts. 
                                        The exception to this requirement is described in subparagraph (e) below. 
                                        In arbitration, there is no judge or jury. 
                                        The arbitrator, however, can award damages just as a judge or jury can.</p>
                                    <p><strong>(b) Arbitration Procedures.</strong> 
                                        Any arbitration proceeding will be administered by a neutral arbitrator who is a member of or affiliated with The American Arbitration Association (AAA), in accordance with its then current rules and procedures pertaining to consumer disputes. 
                                        We will jointly select a single arbitrator, but if we cannot agree on the selection of an arbitrator, the AAA will designate the arbitrator for us. 
                                        The arbitrator may conduct the arbitration by teleconference or videoconference. 
                                        If the arbitrator deems it necessary to conduct the arbitration in person, the arbitration will be held at a location which is mutually agreeable to us. 
                                        In the event we can’t agree on a location, the arbitrator shall choose a location, taking into account the cost and ability to travel of the parties.</p>
                                    <p><strong>(c) Arbitration Fees and Incentives.</strong> 
                                        The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Express Car Parts will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p>
                                    <p><strong>(d) No Class Actions.</strong> 
                                        We agree that all disputes between us will be resolved on an individual basis, and you may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. 
                                        Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.</p>
                                    <p><strong>(e) Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.</strong> 
                                        Either you or Express Car Parts may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in Springfield, Missouri or in any United States county or parish where you live or work. 
                                        Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Site, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in the arbitration described above.</p>
                                    <p><strong>(f) YOU UNDERSTAND, BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS AS SET FORTH ABOVE, THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO RESOLVE YOUR DISPUTE OR CLAIM THROUGH OTHER AVAILABLE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESSES, INCLUDING COURT ACTIONS OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS. 
                                            YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE ALSO WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND, PURSUANT TO SUBPARAGRAPH (d) ABOVE, YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ARBITRATIONS, ACTIONS , OR CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATIONS OF ANY KIND.</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>(g) Governing Law.</strong> 
                                        The Federal Arbitration Act and Applicable Federal Law will govern this agreement to arbitrate. 
                                        Except for the provision relating to the waiver of class and representative actions, if a court decides that any part of this agreement to arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this agreement to arbitrate shall remain in effect. 
                                        If any court finds the provision relating to the waiver of class and representative actions to be invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section regarding Disputes shall not apply.</p>

                                        If the information you provided during checkout fails to coincide with the information on file for the credit card you used, our security system will deny your order. 
                                        If the information you provided is accurate, your credit card will be charged for the full amount of your order on the day that your order is shipped.</p>

                                    <h4>Shipping and Delivery</h4>
                                    <p>All delivery dates provided by Express Car Parts are based upon the package size and weight of the order, and are estimates only. 
                                        Express Car Parts cannot guarantee the speed or accuracy of delivery dates provided by any of its commonly used shipping partners. 
                                        Express Car Parts is also not responsible for the security of deliveries that are missing or stolen from the delivery location. 
                                        Deliveries become the sole responsibility of the customer once the order has reached the address indicated in the tracking information. 
                                        Express Car Parts does not guarantee that your order will be replaced or refunded in the event of a lost or stolen package.</p>

                                        Because actual pricing and sales tax costs vary from location to location, Express Car Parts also does not guarantee the actual pricing for products sold at any of our stores. 
                                        Your final total for purchases that you make online, or at any of our retail locations, may not reflect the same dollar amount that you would pay at another one of our stores.</p>

                                    <h4>Clearance and Promotional Items</h4>
                                    <p>Clearance prices are only good while supplies last, and are provided on a first come, first served basis. 
                                        Express Car Parts does not offer back orders or rain checks on clearance items. 
                                        Our stores are not able to order, restock, or transfer in any clearance items, and Express Car Parts does not substitute any other items for a clearance-priced item. 
                                        Other sales, discounts, or promotional codes will not be applied to clearance pricing, and Express Car Parts does not offer large quantity discounts. 
                                        Clearance items are not eligible for, or count toward, any shipping promotions or discounts, even when combined with other items in your order. 
                                        Express Car Parts does not ship any clearance item, part, or product to another store.</p>
                                    <p>All sales for clearance items are final, and clearance items are sold “as is.” Clearance items cannot be returned or refunded. 
                                        Express Car Parts does not guarantee that the quantity of clearance items you order will be shipped. 
                                        All quantities shown for clearance items are estimates, and if Express Car Parts does not have the quantities you request when your order is processed, you will receive the quantities available to ship.</p>

                                        Your card is not redeemable for cash or credit, unless required by law.

                                        The Issuer of the gift card may assign its rights and duties as Issuer in their entirety to any affiliate or other Issuer without recourse or consent of the gift card owner. 
                                        If assigned, the Issuer shall have no obligation to the gift card owner, and the new Issuer will be the sole obligor. 
                                        The Issuer is not responsible or liable for lost, stolen, or damaged cards, or for cards used without your permission except as required by law. 
                                        Purchase, acceptance, or use of your card constitutes acceptance of these Terms and Conditions, which are subject to change without notice to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
